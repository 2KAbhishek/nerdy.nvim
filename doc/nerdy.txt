Do you like Nerd fonts <https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts>? but don’t
like going over to their site <https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet> to fetch
a glyph for your pretty terminal? Well, me too!

Introducing nerdy.nvim, a super handy plugin that lets you search, preview and
insert all nerd font glyphs straight from neovim!


FEATURES                                                      *nerdy-features*

- Fuzzy search nerd glyphs, by name and unicode
- Preview glyphs before inserting
- Super lightweight
- Can auto generate new icons from source


SETUP                                                            *nerdy-setup*


REQUIREMENTS ~

- You have installed the latest version of `neovim`

These two plugins are optional but highly recommended for a smoother user
experience.

- dressing.nvim <https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim> — for prettier select UI
- telescope <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> — for fuzzy searching in list


INSTALLATION ~

>lua
    -- Lazy
    {
        '2kabhishek/nerdy.nvim',
        dependencies = {
            'stevearc/dressing.nvim',
            'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
        },
        cmd = 'Nerdy',
    },
    
    -- Packer
    use '2kabhishek/nerdy.nvim'
<


USAGE ~

`nerdy.nvim` adds a new command `Nerdy`.

You can add your custom bindings for the command, the recommended keybinding is
`<leader>f,`.

check `:help nerdy` for more details.


  NOTE: By default there are no configured keybindings.

TELESCOPE EXTENSION

Nerdy also comes with a Telescope extension, to use it add the following to
your telescope configs.

>lua
    require('telescope').load_extension('nerdy')
<

And then call

>viml
    :Telescope nerdy
    " or
    :lua require('telescope').extensions.nerdy.nerdy()
<


FETCH NEW ICONS

Running the `python scripts/generator.py` command will automatically fetch new
icons from source
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/master/glyphnames.json>
and update the icons.


BEHIND THE CODE                                        *nerdy-behind-the-code*


INSPIRATION ~

I love nerd font glyphs, and I use them anywhere I can! but I was wasting a lot
of time going back and forth between nerd font site and neovim, also the copy
feature was super buggy for me on the site, so I made nerdy!


CHALLENGES/LEARNINGS ~

- Making the generated icon table with vim.ui.select was a bit tricky.


TOOLING ~

- dots2k <https://github.com/2kabhishek/dots2k> — Dev Environment
- nvim2k <https://github.com/2kabhishek/nvim2k> — Personalized Editor


MORE INFO ~

- nerdicons.nvim <https://github.com/nvimdev/nerdicons.nvim> — thanks to the original authors for the groundwork.
- co-author.nvim <https://github.com/2kabhishek/co-author.nvim> — Another one of my plugin that lets you add co authors.
